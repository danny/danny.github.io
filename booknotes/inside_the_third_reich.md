This book provides some remarkable insights into world war 2.  It's also interesting since Speer is not a disinterested narrator.

>Quite often even the most important step in a man's life, his choice of vocation, is taken quite frivolously.  He does not bother to find out enough about the basis and the various aspects of that vocation. Once he has chosen it, he is inclined to switch off his critical awareness and to fit himself wholly into the predetermined career.

***Page 19***

>For had I only wanted to, I could have found out even then that Hitler was proclaiming expansion of the Reich to the east; that he was a rank anti-Semite; that he was committed to a system of authoritarian rule; that after attaining power he intended to eliminated democratic procedures and would thereafter yield only to force.  Not to have worked that out for myself; not, given my education, to have read books, magazines, and newspapers of various viewpoints; not to have tried to see through the whole apparatus of mystification - was already criminal. At this initial stage my guilt was as grave as, at the end, my work for Hitler.  ***For being in a position to know and nevertheless shunning knowledge creates direct responsibility for the consequences - from the very beginning.*** (emphasis added)

>I felt myself to be Hitler's architect.  Political events did not concern me.  My job was merely to provide impressive backdrops for such events.  And this view was reinforced daily, for Hitler consulted me almost exclusively on architectural questions.  Moreover, it would have been regarded as self-importance on the part of a man who was pretty much of a latecomer in the party had I attempted to participate in the political discussions.  I felt that there was no need for me to take any political positions at all.  Nazi education, furthermore, aimed at separatist thinking; I was expected to confine myself to the job of building.  The grotesque extent to which I clung to this illusion is indicated by a memorandum of mine to Hitler as late as 1944: "The task I have to fulfill is an unpolitical one. I have felt at ease in my work only so long as my person and my work were evaluated solely by the standard of practical accomplishments."

***Page 113***

>But in the final analysis I myself determined the degree of my isolation, the extremity of my evasions, and the extent of ignorance.

>Those who ask me are fundamentally expecting me to offer justifications.  But I have none.  No apologies are possible.

>He stuck unswervingly to his opinion that the West was too feeble, too worn out, and too decadent to begin the war seriously.  Probably it was also embarrassing for him to admit to his entourage and above all to himself that he had made so crucial a mistake.  I still remember his consternation when the news came that Churchill was going to enter the British War Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty.  With this ill omened press report in his hand, Goering stepped out of the door of Hitler's salon.  He dropped into the nearest chair and said wearily: "Churchill in the Cabinet.  That means that the war is really on.  Now we shall have war with England." From these and other observations I deduced that this initiation of real war was not what Hitler had projected.

>I prepared a plan of organization whose vertical lines represented individual items, such as tanks, planes, or submarines.  In other words, the armaments for the three branches of the service were included.  These vertical columns were enclosed in numerous rings, each of which was to stand for a group of components needed for all guns, tanks, planes, and other armaments.  Within these rings I considered, for example, the production of forgings or ball bearings or electrical equipment as a whole.  Accustomed as an architect to three-dimensional thinking, I drew this new organizational scheme in perspective.

***Page 212***

>Basically, I exploited the phenomenon of the technician's often blind devotion to his task.  Because of what seems to be the moral neutrality of technology, these people were without any scruples about their activities.  The more technicial the world imposed on us by the war, the more dangerous was the indifference of the technician to the direct consequences of his anonymous activities.

>The nonparty members of my Ministry enjoyed a legal protection highly unusual in Hitler's state.  For over the objections of the Minister of Justice I had established the principle, right at the beginning of my job, that there would be no indictments for sabotage of armaments except on my motion.  This proviso protected my associates even after July 20, 1944.  Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the Gestapo chief, wanted to indict three general managers, Bucher of the AEG electrical company, Vogler of the United Steel Works, and Reusch of the Gutehoffnungshutte (the mining combine), for "defeatist" conversations. He came to me for authorization.  I pointed out that the nature of our work compelled us to speak candidly about the situation and thus fended off the Gestapo.  On the other hand, I applied severe penalties for abuse of our honor system - if, for example, someone furnished false data in order to hoard important raw materials.  For actions of this sort would result in the withholdings of arms from the front.

***Page 213***

>There were times when I actually regarded theses raids as helpful - witness my ironic reaction to the destruction of the Ministry in the air raid of November 22, 1943: "Although we have been fortunate in that large parts of the current files of the Ministry have burned and so relieved us for a time of useless ballast, we cannot really expect that such events will continually introduce the necessary fresh air into our work."

***Page 250, 2nd footnote***

>Hitler could not have blocked delivery of these letters without causing wild rumors.  But when the Soviet Army allowed German prisoners to send home postcards, Hitler ordered the cards destroyed.  Because they were a sign of life from the relatives, they might have mitigated the Russophobia that was being so carefully cultivated by Hitler's propaganda apparatus.  Fritzsche told me about this at Nuremberg.

***Page 259***

>This was the first time I emerged from my reserve as a specialist to plunge into political maneuvering.  I had always carefully avoided such a step; but the fact that I took it now had a certain logic.  I had decided that it was wrong to imagine I could concentrate exclusively upon my specialized work.  In an authoritarian system anyone who wants to remain part of the leadership inevitably stumbles into fields of force where political battles are in progress.

***Page 269***

>I was thunderstruck.

***Page 282***

>Whereas the gradual industrial growth of the West had resulted in many middle-sized power plants connected in a grid, in the Soviet Union large power plants of gigantic dimensions had been built, usually in the heart of extensive industrial areas.  For example, a single huge power plant on the upper Volga supplied most of the energy consumption of Moscow.  We had information, in fact, that 60 percent of the manufacturing of essential optical parts and electrical equipment was concentrated in the Soviet capital.  Moreover, the destruction of a few gigantic power plants in the Urals would have put a halt to much of Soviet steel production as well as to tank and munitions manufacture.  A direct hit on the turbines or their conduits would have released masses of water a destructiveness greater than that of many bombs.  Since many of the major Soviet power plants had been built with the assistance of German companies, we were able to obtain very good data on them.

>From the flak tower the air raids on Berlin were an unforgettable sight, and I had constantly to remind myself of the cruel reality in order not to be completely entranced by the scene: the illumination of the parachute flares, which the Berliners called "Christmas trees," followed by flashes of explosions which were caught by the clouds of smoke, the innumerable probing searchlights, the excitement when a plan was caught and tried to escape the cone of light, the brief flaming torch when it was hit.  No doubt about it, this apocalypse provided a magnificent spectacle.

***Page 289***

>In this way Hitler, too, learned of the blaze, and without making any further inquiries ordered all the fire departments in the vicinity of Berlin to report to the burning tank plant.

>Since a direct order from the Fuehrer had been issued, I could not persuade the chiefs to go on to other urgent fies.  Early that morning the streets in a wide area around the tank factory were jammed with fire engines standing around doing nothing - while the fires spread unchecked in other parts of the city.

>Goering was embarking for Rominten Heath on his special train when Galland came along to bid him good-by.  "What's the idea of telling the Fuehrer that American fighters have penetrated into the territory of the Reich?" Goering snapped at him.

"<em>Herr rechsmarschall,</em>" Galland replied with imperturbable calm, "they soon will be flying even deeper."

Goering Spoke even more vehemently: "That's nonsense, Galland, what gives you such fantasies? That's pure bluff!"

Galland shook his head.  "Those are the facts, <em>Herr Reichsmarschall!</em>"  As he spoke he deliberately remained in a casual posture, his cap somewhat askew, a long cigar clamped between his teeth.  "American fighters have been shot down over Aachen.  There is no doubt about it!

Goering obstinately held his ground: "That is simply not true, Galland.  It's impossible."

Galland reacted with a touch of mockery: "You might go and check it yourself, sir; the downed planes are there at Aachen. "

Goering tried to smooth matters over: "Come now, Galland, let me tell you something.  I'm an experienced fighter pilot myself.  I know what is possible.  But I know what isn't, too.  Admit you made a mistake."

Galland only shook his head, until Goering finally declared: " What must have happened is that they were shot down much farther to the west.  I mean, if they were very high when they were shot down they could have glided quite a distance farther before they crashed."

Not a muscle moved in Galland's face.  "Glided to the east, sir? If my plane were shot up ..."

"Now then, Herr Galland," Goering fulminated, trying to put an end to the debate, "I officially assert that the American fighter planes did not reach Aachen."

The General ventured a last statement: "But, sir, they were there!"

At this point Goering's self-control gave way. "I herewith give you an official order that they weren't there! Do you understand?  The American fighters were not there! Get that! I intend to report that to the Fuehrer. "

Goering simply let General Galland stand there.  But as he stalked off he turned once more and called out threateningly: "You have my official order!"

With an unforgettable smile the General replied: "Orders are orders, sir!"

>The departure from reality, which was visibly spreading like a contagion, was no peculiarity of the National Socialist regime.  But in normal circumstances  people who turn their backs on reality are soon set straight by the mockery and criticism of those around them, which makes them aware they have lost credibility.  In the Third Reich there was no such correctives, especially for those who belonged to the upper stratum.  On the contrary, every self-deception was multiplied as in a hall of distorting mirrors, becoming a repeatedly confirmed picture of a fantastical dream world which no longer bore any relationship to the grim outside world.  In those mirrors I could see nothing but my own face reproduced many times over.  No external factors disturbed the uniformity of the hundreds of unchanging faces, all mine.

***Page 312***

>You will please take note of this: The manner in which the various districts [Gaue]  have hitherto obstructed the shutdown of consumer goods production can and will no longer be tolerated.  Henceforth, if the districts do not respond to my requests within two weeks I shall myself order the shutdowns.  And I can assure that  I am prepared to apply the authority of the Reich government at any cost!  I have spoken with Reichsfuhrer-SS Himmler, and from now on I shall deal firmly with the districts that do not carry out these measures.

***Page 339***

>So far as I recollect, this was the first time that the specter of "scorched earth" loomed before me.  For Rohland went on to speak of the fear that a desperate top leadership might order wholesale destruction. Then and there, on that day, I felt something stirring within me that was quite apart from Hitler: a sense of responsibility toward the country and the people to save as much as possible of our industrial potential, so that the nation could survive the period after a lost war.  But for the present it was still a vague and shadowy sense.

***Page 342***

>When I analyzed the complex of motives which so surprisingly led me back to this intimate circle, I realized that the desire to retain the position of power I had achieved was unquestionably a major factor.  Even though I was only shining in the reflected light of Hitler's power - and I don't think I ever deceived myself on that score - I still found it worth striving for.  I wanted, as part of his following, to gather some of his popularity, his glory, his greatness, around myself.  Up to 1942, I still felt that my vocation as an architected allowed me a measure of pride that was independent of Hitler.  But since then I had been bribed and intoxicated by the desire to wield pure power, to assign people to this and that, to say the final word on important questions, to deal with expenditures in the billions.  I thought I was prepared to resign, but I would have sorely missed the heady stimulus that comes wither leadership.  The deep misgivings I had been having lately were, moreover, put to rout by the appeal from the industrialists, as well as by Hitler's magnetic power, which he could still radiate with virtually undiminished force.  To be sure, our relationship had developed a crack; my loyalty had become shaky, and I sensed that it would never again be what it had been.  But for the resent I was back in Hitler's circle - and content.

***Page 375***

>I realize that the sight of suffering people influenced only my emotions, but not my conduct.  On the plane of feelings only sentimentality emerged; in the realm of decisions, on the other hand, I continued to be ruled by the principles of utility. In the nuremberg Trial the indictment against me was based on the use of prisoners in the armaments factories.

>For in either case I was moving within the system.  What disturbs me more is that I failed to read the physiognomy of the regime mirrored in the faces of those prisoners - the regime whose existence I was so obsessively trying to prolong during those weeks and months.  I did not see any moral ground outside the system where I should have taken my stand.  And sometimes I ask myself who this young man really was, this young man who has now become so alien to me, who walked through the workshops of the Linz steelworks or descended into the caverns of the Central Works twenty-five years ago.

***Page 375/376***

>This time, sitting in the green leather easy chair in my office, he seemed confused and spoke falteringly, with man breaks.  He advised me never to accept an invitation to inspect a concentration campe in Upper Silesia.  Never, under any circumstances.  He had seen something there which he was not permitted to describe and moreover could not describe.
>
>I did not query him, I did not query Himmler, I did not query Hitler, I did not speak with personal friends.  I did not investigate - for I did not want to know what was happening there.  Hanke must have been speaking of Auschwitz.  During those few seconds, while Hanke was warning me, the whole responsibility had become a reality again.  Those seconds were uppermost in my mind when I stated to the international court at the Nuremberg Trial that as an important member of the leadership of the Reich, I had to share the total responsibility for all that had happened.  For from that moment on, I was inescapably contaminated morally; from fear of discovering something which might have made me turn from my course, I had closed my eyes. This deliberate blindness outweighs whatever good I may have done or tried to do in the last period of the war.  Those activities shrink to nothing in the face of it.  Because I failed at that time, I still feel, to this day, responsible for Auschwitz in a wholly personal sense.

***Page 411***

>During the closing months of the war a growing band of desperate people began pinning their hopes on the astrological sheets.  Since these were dependent on the Propaganda Ministry, for a variety of reasons they were, as I learned from Fritzsche at Nuremberg, used as a tool for influencing public opinion.  Fake horoscopes spoke of valleys of darkness which had to be passed through, foretold imminent surprises, intimated happy outcomes.  Only in the astrological sheets did the regime still have a future.

***Page 440***

>I was relieved when I at last sat at the wheel of my car in the fresh night air, Hitler's chauffeur at my side and Lieutenant Colonel von Poser, my liaison officer to the General Staff, on the rear seat.  Kemptka had agreed that we would take turns driving.  By this time it was about half past one in the morning, and speed was of the essence if we were to cover the three hundred odd miles of autobahn to the headquarters of the Command in Chief, West, near Nauheim, before daybreak - for then the enemy hedgehopping fighters appeared.  We had the radio tuned to the broadcaster for the night fighters and kept the grid map on our knees: "Night fighters in grid Number - ... Sever Mosquitoes in grid - ... Night fighters in grid ..." This way we knew exactly where the enemy was.  If a formation were approaching us, we would switch to our parking lights and feel our way slowly along the edge of the road.  As soon as our square on the grid map was free of the enemy, we switched to high beam and fog lights, turned on the big jacklight, and with our supercharger howling, roared down the autobahn.  By morning we were still on the road, but low-lying clouds had brought air activity to a standstill.  At headquarters, I first of all lay down for a few hours sleep.

***Page 489***

>Two weeks later, staggered by the revelations of the crimes in the concentration camps, I wrote to the chairman of the ministerial cabinet, Schwerin-Krosigk: "The previous leadership of the German nation bears a collective guilt for the fate that now hangs over the German people.  Each member of that leadership must personally assume his responsibility in such a way that the guilt which might otherwise descend upon the German people is expiated. "

>With that, there began a segment of my life which has not ended to this day.

***Page 500***

>... General Anderson paid me the most curious and flattering compliment of my career: "Had I known what this man was achieving, I would have sent out the entire American Eighth Air Force merely to  put him underground." That air force had at its disposal more than two thousand heavy daylight bombers.  It was luck General Anderson found out too late.

>Early in the morning two days later my adjutant came rushing into my bedroom.  The British had surrounded Glucksburg.  A sergeant entered my room and announced that I was prisoner.  He unbuckled his belt with its pistol, laid it casually on my table, and left the room to give me an opportunity to pack my things.

>Hitler's dictatorship was the first dictatorship of an industrial state in this age of modern technology, a dictatorship which employed to perfection the instruments of technology to dominate its own people ... By means of such instruments of technology as the radio and public-address systems, eighty million persons could be made subject to the will of one individual.  Telephone, teletype, and radio made it possible to transmit the commands of the highest levels directly to the lowest organs where because of their high authority they were executed uncritically.  Thus many offices and squads received their evil commands in this direct manner.  The instruments of technology made it possible to maintain a close watch over all citizens and to keep criminal operations shrouded in a high degree of secrecy.  To the outsider this state apparatus may look like the seemingly wild tangle of cables in a telephone exchange; but like such an exchange it could be directed by a single will.  Dictatorships of the past needed assistants of high quality in the lower ranks of the leadership also - men who could think and act independently.  The authoritarian system in the age of technology can do without such men.  The means of communication alone enable it to mechanize the work of the lower leadership.  Thus the type of uncritical receiver of orders is created.

***Page 523***

>Today, a quater of a century after these events, it is not only specific faults that burden my conscience, great as these may have been.  My moral failure is not a matter of this item and that; it resides in my active association with the whole course of events. I had participated in a war which, as we of the intimate circle should never have doubted, was aimed at world dominion.  What is more, by my abilities and my energies I had prolonged that war by many months.  I had assented to having the globe of the world crown that domed hall which was to be the symbol of new Berlin.  Nor was it only symbolically that Hitler dreamed of possessing the globe.  It was part of his dream to subjugate the other nations.  France, I had heard him say many times, was to be reduced to the status of a small nation.  Belgium, Holland, even Burgundy, wer to be incorporated into his Reich.  The national life of the Poles and the Soviet Russians was to be extinguished; they were to be made into helot peoples.  Nor, for one who wanted to listen, had Hitler ever concealed his intention to exterminated the Jewish people.  In his speech of January 30, 1939, he openly stated as much.  Although I never actually agreed with Hitler on these questions, I had nevertheless designed the buildings and produced the weapons which served his ends.

***Page 524***

>"The catastrophe of this war," I wrote in my cell in 1947, "has proved the sensitivity of the system of modern civilization evolved in the course of centuries.  Now we know that we do not live in an earthquake-proof structure.  The build-up of negative impulses, each reinforcing the other, can inexorably shake to pieces the complicated apparatus of the modern world.  There is no halting this process by will alone.  The danger is that the automatism of progress will depersonalize man further and withdraw more and moe of his self-responsibility."

>Dazzled by the possibilities of technology, I devoted crucial years of my life to serving it.  But in the end my feelings about it are highly skeptical.]]&gt;</content:encoded>
